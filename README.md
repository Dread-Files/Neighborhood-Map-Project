# Neighborhood-Map-Project

A project for practicing with APIs and the Knockout JavaScript library.

## How the App Works

Simply double-click google-map.html to launch the app.

## Main Functions

1) Google Maps functions just the same as the original does and is used to place 5 predefined markers.

2) A side panel was made with html and has the 5 markers in a list.

3) The search bar at the top of the side panel is used to filter through the list and displays what the user wants to see.

4) The list of markers in the side panel was created with knockout library and will center on a marker and open it's infowindow when selected.
