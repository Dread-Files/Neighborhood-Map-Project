# Neighborhood-Map-Project

A project for practicing with APIs and the Knockout JavaScript library.

## Main functions

1) Google Maps functions just the same as the origonal does and is used to place 5 predefined markers.

2) A side panel was made with html and has the 5 markers in a list.

3) The search bar at the top of the side panel is suppose to filter through the list, but is currently unresponsive.

4) The list of markers in the side panel was created with the knockout library simply stays like that.
